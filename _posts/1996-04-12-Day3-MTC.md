# April 12, 1996. MTC

Today went a lot better and quicker. It was my first full regular day. I spent
about 10 hours in class. I can tell that I'm improving already in the language.
I'm still positive I'll get better with a little work. The other guys in my
district are pretty cool. So far, last night and tonight, they just talk and
talk for hours. They're good conversations, most of them, but I'd rather study
German and the scriptures. My district is getting a lot closer. I kind of think
that we should all be like the rest of the MTC, but it's only the third day.
We'll get there, it only takes time. I feel discouraged when everyone but my
district can speak German. I can't express exactly how I feel. I just wish I
could speak German now. I guess I'm learning patience. It seems like the time
when I will be able to comprehend and speak German well, will never come, like
it's a million years away. We are required, starting the fourth week, to SYL
(speak your language). Only with God's help will I be able to reach that and my
other goals.
