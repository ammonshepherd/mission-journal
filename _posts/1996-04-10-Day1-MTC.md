# April 10, 1996. Day 1 - MTC

## 3:00 pm

Well I'm here. I made it safe and sound. My flight was great. I loved it. I want
to fly a lot now, it was really neat. My experiences so far have been real well.
My flight came into Salt Lake at 10:30. Four other guys and I all came to the
MTC together. I was supposed to report at 2:30pm but got here at 12:00pm. So I
got to eat lunch for a while. After a good hardy meal of pizza and fruit salad,
I and my new found friends were off to orientation. I was kind of glad I had
already said my good byes at the airport. Speaking of that. It was neat.
Brandon, Ryan, Jake, Tarik, Craig, Matt, and Steve were there to see me off.
Along with my family and stuff.

## 11:45pm

I tried to get to sleep early but some Elder came in and talked to us forever.
Also, me, my comp, and the other two Elders get along well so we talk forever.
It is really strange to be here. I wish I had a blanket; my feet are cold. I'm
going to try and sleep now. Tomorrow is another big day.
