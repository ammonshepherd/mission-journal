# April 16, 1996. Day 7 - MTC

I still haven't received any Briefe [letters]. I'm not the only one, though.
Mein Mitarbeiter auch haben keine Briefe [My companion also has no letters]. Auch
[also] Elder Virgin. I learned a lot today in mein Klasse [my class]. I learned
how to structure sentences with dative cases. It's neat how quickly I can learn,
or comprehend this stuff. It kind of feels like my classes are just for learning
German and not any discussions or any other missionary stuff. Today, though, was
really neat. We did a lot of neat missionary stuff. It seemed as if we
emphasized more on missionary work. We had an exercise in Br√ºder Snarr's class
where we and another district went outside and pretended we were missionaries
and investigators, and worked on our approaches. I sang in the choir in the
devotional. It was an awesome experience.
