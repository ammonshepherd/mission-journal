# April 18, 1996. Day 9 - MTC

Today was another spiritual day, at least the afternoon class. We did a lot of
things to bring in the Spirit and I felt it a lot. We watched a film of like
Thanksgiving songs, sung by BYU choir. It was really awesome.

What also made this day great was that I finally got mail. It put me on a happy
high. I read it twice in a row. The letter made me miss home, but not enough to
get home sick or anything. I just wonder whats going on at home.

The last thing that made this day really "cool" was that it snowed. The day
started off just raining, but then by 12pm lunch time, it was snowing. The snow
stuck pretty well to the ground for a few hours, but by the time Evening class
was over, 9:00pm, all the snow was melted. I forgot to bring my camera along so
I got no pictures of it. I'm hoping that maybe it'll snow again so that I can
get a picture of it. [Growing up in the deserts of Arizona, this was probably
the second or third time I had seen snow fall from the sky.]

I got my pictures back also. Half or more of them are of Ben when he was in
Taiwan and of him and Holly. Now it's going to cost me an arm and a leg to send
them all home. Well, it's time to lessen meine heiligen Schriften [read my Holy
Scriptures].
