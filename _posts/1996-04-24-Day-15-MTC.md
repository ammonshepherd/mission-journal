# 1996-04-24. Day 15 - MTC

Today went pretty awesome. The best thing about heute [today] was the P.M. class. Elder I. and I gave the erste Lektion [first discussion] to zwei [two] other Elders. It was sehr Toll [very cool]. Even though we were both nervous and didn't know past the zweite [second] principle, we did pretty well. We were able to bring in the Spirit and get lots of feedback on how to make our presentation better. What was also cool was Sis. D. was our Lehrerin [teacher]. Sie will im eine woche auch fur [she will also in a week for] Br. C. while he is on his honeymoon. She is an awesome teacher. A lot of fun and easy to learn from. She's only been back from her mission for four months. I also played sand volleyball. That was fun.
