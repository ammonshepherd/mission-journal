# 1996-04-21. Day 21 - MTC

Today was pretty good. I think I'm going to like Sundays a lot here at the MTC. For one, there is a lot of free time. I got a two hour nap today, before sacrament meeting. What also made today swell was choir practice. We, the choir, found out that we are singing for the satellite broadcast on Friday. And that there will be three or four apostles here and we'll be hooked up by satellite with Pres. Hinkley. And best of all, the whole broadcast is going to be seen all over this side of the world, North and South America and all them islands. So if I can get word to home, they should be able to see it on Friday. The only thing is, is that it's at 10:00 in the morning for us. I'm not sure what it will be for the rest of the country. I'll, and everybody, will find out wether Elder G. has to leave, today.
