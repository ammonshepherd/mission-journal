# April 15, 1996. MTC

Today was what will bcome a normal day at the MTC. Everything went pretty
normal. We had a LGM (Large Group Meeting) today. It was about the commitment
pattern, and teaching by the Spirit. The teacher presented three steps for
teaching by the Spirit.

1. Know what the Spirit feels like
2. Know what can be done to create the proper atmosphere
3. Know what missionaries can do to be led by the Spirit.

We also learned what the Spirit feels like and how to tell.

Today at lunch was pretty funny. Elder A. put salt in Elder I.'s
drink every time Elder I. turned around. The salt didn't do anything, it
was that we were all looking at him. He started laughing and his O.J. came out
his nose. It was so funny. The Sisters must think we, the Elders, are really
childish, and we are. Vorgestern Abend [two nights ago] Elder O. gave a suit
to one of the Elders a few doors down. The suit didn't fit Elder O., that's
why he gave it to the other Elder. It was really nice, since the suit cost $650.
The other Elder then brought in a suit that was too small for him. We thought it
might fit Elder I., but it didn't. It did fit me, though. So I get it.
It's a pretty nice suit, too. Dark grey, kind of, in color. Now I have three
suits.
