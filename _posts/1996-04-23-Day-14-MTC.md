# 1996-04-23. Day 14 - MTC

I sent a letter home telling them about the missionary broadcast on Friday. If I would have waited until later in the afternoon today, I could have sent the copy of my mission call. Mom asked for it because she needs the proof so I can get off the insurance. It was a funny thing about me getting a copy of my call. All I had was a $20 bill with me and the copy was only four cents, and they didn't have change enough for me. Luckily the Elder just before me had three cents change and the fellow working there had another penny. I felt pretty stupid. The dumb thing about it was that after that I went down to the Buchhandlung [book store] and bought two spiral note books and colored pencils. So then I had change. We had a fireside tonight. It was pretty good. We, the choir, sang pretty well.
