# April 11, 1996. Day 2 - MTC

Today went well. I'm still in a state of semi-shock. The first few days, I fear, I'll feel inept. I don't like that feeling, but it should pass in a few days. We had one language class today for three or so hours. I can't help but feel incompitent. It seems like I'll never learn the language. President Jensen said that if I try as hard as I can, the Spirit will be able to do the rest. He also said not to worry about it. My companion, Elder Richmond, is really cool. He's from Salt Lake. I think we'll be able to get along real well. I wrote my first letter home, but I don't have any stamps or envelopes so I'll have to wait till tomorrow to send them out. Tomorrow will be our first real day. I don't miss the family like really bad. Hopefully I don't get homesick.

When I first got here it seemed like this was my mission. That is why I think I feel so uncomfortable. I need to get in the mindset that I'm only here for two months, and then my real mission begins.

It's weird, the other Elders, the ones who have been here longer, look so much older. My District Leader, for example, is only 9 days older than me, but he looks so much older. It seems like they know so much, and they do. I have the opportunity to learn so much in these 8 weeks. If I really apply myself, I know I can do it.
