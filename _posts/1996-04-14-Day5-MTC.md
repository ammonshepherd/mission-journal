Today we found out who our District Leader is. I had thought that it would be
me, but just a little. I'm kind of glad I'm not. I got pretty close, though. My
companion, Elder I., was called to be our District Leader. Now I get to go
to all the meetings that he gets to go to.

Today was supposed to be Sunday. It is, but it doesn't feel like it at all. I
think mainly it is because we still go to all the same places. Before, Sunday
was special because we got to go to church, somewhere where you're not everyday.
But here, there is nowhere else to go. It'll just take some getting used to.

We went to the Temple today as a District. I got a few pictures, and a little
nap. It is such a beautiful place up there.

The day before yesterday (vorgestern), two sisters came up to Elder I. and
me and bore their testimony to us auf Deutsch [in German]. Then we had to bear
ours to some Sisters by the next day. Then they are supposed to bear theirs to
some Elders by the next day and so forth. It was pretty cool.
