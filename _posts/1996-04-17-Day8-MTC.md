# April 17, 1996. Day 8 - MTC

Well, it's been a whole week. It feels like a year. Elder E. was joking in
class about that. A week is like a year at the MTC. Well then, we have only 7
years left. Today at lunch I was dared to try and slurp up a cup of jello cubes
in 15 seconds. It took me at least four times to try, because everyone kept on
laughing and making me laugh. I made it in about 16 seconds, though. I did get a
dollar out of it. It is so hard for me to study die Schriften [the scriptures]
and to even say my prayers. My companion and roomies talk and talk and talk. I
just try to concentrate.
